What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
Merge and Rebase both apply changes from a source branch to a target branch. The difference is that merge keeps each branch's logs separate, whereas, rebase creates a linear history of both branches' logs.

What is a remote repository?
It is the version of the project that is kept on the internet. It is typically used to clone the project into a local repository for editting, and after edits are reviewed and confirmed, it can push changes onto the remote repository.
